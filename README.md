HTML study and practice repository

This repository contains my HTML practice files created while learning HTML concepts.
I have already studied HTML before, but now Iâ€™m brushing up my knowledge by revisiting each topic and practicing again.

Purpose:

Brush up my HTML knowledge.
Track my learning journey.
Keep my code organized for easy review.
Push daily progress to GitHub.
